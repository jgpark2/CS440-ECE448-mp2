Heuristic are used to determine which variable to assign next


constraint propagation refers to technique of looking ahead
in the search as yet unassigned variables

forward checking - when a variable is instantiated, we check all
constraints that have only one uninstantiated variable remaining. For that
uninstantiated variable, we check all of its values, pruning those values that 
violate the constraint
/*
/* this method just checks the constraint C */
/*
FCCheck(C,x)
// C is a constraint with all its variables already
// assigned, except for variable x.
for d := each member of CurDom[x]
if making x = d together with
previous assignments to
variables in scope C falsifies C
then
remove d from CurDom[x]
if CurDom[x] = {} then return DWO (Domain Wipe Out)
return ok

Can also use arc consistancy

CSP is called an n-ary CSP where n is max number of distinct variables over which
a constraint is specified. (ex. binary CSP has constraints involving only two variables)
 note: any n-ary csp can be converted to binary csp

 In BT variables are instantiated one by one When a variable is instantiated
a value from its domain is picked and assigned to it Then constraint checks are
performed to make sure that the new instantiation is compatible with all the in
stantiations made so far If all the completed constraints are satised this variable
has been instantiated successfully and we can move on to instantiate the next vari
able If it violates certain constraints then an alternative value when available is
picked If all the variables haveavalue noting that all the assignments are consis
tent the problem is solved If at any stage no value can be assigned to a variable
without violating a constraint backtracking occurs That means the most recent
instantiated variable has its instantiation revised and a new value if available is
assigned to it At this point we continue on to try instantiating the other variables
or we backtrack farther This carries on until either a solution is found or all the
combinations of instantiation have been tried and have failed which means that
there is no solution
